This is a report for 3D modeling project using freeglut.

# 1. Introduction
This is a 3D scene describing Central building (CB) and Science buildings (SBs) in north campus of Xi’an
Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) in real life. This scene contains techniques such as lighting, fog, texture 
mapping and viewing transformation, moving animation. There are ten objects in this scene in total, which 
are respectively Central building, four science buildings (SA, SB, SC, SD), road, trees, moving cars and buses 
and skybox. In addition, keyboard interactions and mouse control are implemented in the program, which 
provide zoom function and viewing transformation along with switches of texture, lighting, and fog effects. 
This report will discuss the graphic features in detail and provide instructions to run the program interactively 
by posting screen shots of each stage and image materials used in the program.

# 2. Graphic Features
All the graphic techniques are drawn in a world coordinate system, and they are placed in a large virtual 
box. Objects in the scene are drawn by hierarchical modelling with their own coordinate systems. For the 
viewing and window reshaping, perspective projection matrix is utilized. In the texture mapping technique, 
there are totally 12 pictures used in this program. After transferring the bmp picture to pixel data and 
binding, their IDs are stored in an integer list GLuint texture[12] whose length is 12.

## 2.1 Central Building 
This central Building is drawn through hierarchical modelling. Cubes composing of the main body of the building are bound with strips in black and white which are generated by texture mapping through “strip.bmp”
which is shown below. Similarly, the logos of XJTLU on the top of the building are generated through “XJTLU.bmp”. To fuse the colour of textures and materials `GL_MODULATE` is used in `glTexParameterf()`. Edges 
of each fragment are decorated with brown cubes stretched by scaling and they are translated to the right 
position. Coordinates of each fragment of CB are computed elaborately and translated to the position.

## 2.2 Science Buildings 



Science buildings are also drawn through hierarchical modelling. The green grids on the front and back are generated by texture mapping through “greenGrid.bmp” and the brown grids on the left and right are generated through “brownGrid.bmp”. Also, the strips on the intermediate layer are produced through “strip1.bmp”. The three textures are demonstrated below. After modelling SA, the other three buildings SB, SC, SD are drawn by translating and rotating the original SA, thus reducing the redundant codes.

## 2.3 Skybox 

Skybox is generated through sticking six separated sky pictures to a large cube surrounding the whole scene and it ranges from (-6000, -6000, -60000) to (6000, 6000 ,6000). The six consecutive images “front.bmp”, ”back.bmp”, ”left.bmp” ,”right.bm”, ”top.bmp”, ”bottom.bmp” are mapped to the top, bottom, front, back, left and right of the surrounding cubic respectively and they are connected to each other, so that if observing inside the large box, the sky is the same as a whole picture taken in the real world. To make the 
textures not interfered with materials, `GL_REPLACE` is used in `glTexParameterf()`.

The consecutive images are presented below:

## 2.4 Road and Trees
The road is drawn by stretching the cubes. Zebra lines on it and trees consisting of Icosahedrons and cubes beside it are drawn through translations embedded in a for loop, so that they are placed consecutively. In addition, the road on the back of CB is generated through translating and rotating the original front road. The ground where all the objects stand is drawn by a huge cube with grass texture “greenGrass.bmp” bound to 
it which is shown below:

<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20210207195013558.bmp?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L0hoaGhoYW9oYW8=,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70" style="zoom:33%;" />

## 2.5 Moving Cars 

There are moving cars on each of the two roads. The cars are drawn by a body consisting of cubes and four tyres consisting of cylinders. Two different kinds of cars are all generated by copying the original car. The 
motion of each car is enabled by `glutIdleFunc()`, so that they can appear moving in the opposite direction on the different lanes. Each round of function call, a global variable named `carD` will increase by one. In the 
drawing function `drawCars()` where this global variable is used, translate function is applied to move the cars by the value of `carD`. 

## 2.6 Viewing 
Perspective transformation is implemented through `gluLookAt()`. The detailed parameters inside are 
demonstrated below:
`gluLookAt(fltX0 * fltZoom, fltY0 * fltZoom, fltZ0 * fltZoom, fltXRef * fltZoom, fltYRef * fltZoom, fltZRef * fltZoom, fltXUp,
fltYUp, fltZUp);`
Where `fltX0`, `fltY0`,` fltZ0` are the camera position of X, Y, Z coordinate, `fltXRef`, `fltYRef`, `fltZRef` are the coordinates of look￾at position, and `fltZoom` is the zoom value of viewing, `fltXUp`, `fltYUp`, `fltZUp` are the direction of camera up vector which 
are not changeable. 

When moving the viewing position, parameters of look at positions and camera positions are changed simultaneously. Parallelly, when changing look-at position, only parameters of look at position are changed. So that the viewing transformation is implemented. In addition, viewing is triggered by keyboard interaction.

## 2.7 Fog and Lighting 

To make the scene real, fog and lighting are implemented in the program. Also, they can be trigger by pressing left key of mouse and pressing “z” on the keyboard. To make the fog effects real, the colour of fog is set to 
light blue which is the same as the sky. Besides, colour materials are enabled to allow different colour displaying on the transferred objects by calling `glColorMaterial(GL_FRONT, GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE)`, 
`glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL) and glEnable(GL_NORMALIZE)`.

# 3. Instructions
