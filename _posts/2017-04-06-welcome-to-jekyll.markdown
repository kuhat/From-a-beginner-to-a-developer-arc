These are the notes I took when reading the official guidence of these developing tools. They are essential techniques needed in the field of backend development.  Some of these ideas are originated from myself, and It is certainly not so authoritative. There are also some testing codes and instances runned by myself to help comprehension. Anyway, hope you find something useful! And I will update these pages constantly.
