### Overview

 In a nutshell, **Maven** is an attempt to **apply patterns to a project’s build infrastructure** in order to **promote comprehension and productivity** by providing a clear path in the use of best practices. **Maven** is essentially a project management and comprehension tool and as such provides a way to help with managing:

+ Builds
+ Documentation
+ Reporting
+ Dependencies
+ SCMs
+ Releases
+ Distribution

Maven can provide benefits for your build process by **employing standard conventions and practices** to accelerate your development cycle while at the same time helping you achieve a higher rate of success.
